Welcome to the Carbon Quadoxide Initiative's second modpack: Cat. Cat is a Gregtech pack with a fair number of mods, and is pretty easy to get through. However, it is by no means a walk in the park. There are resources to manage, places to adventure, and machines to build. Feel free to consult wikis, NEI and the ingame documentation.
